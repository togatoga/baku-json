# monkey-json

`monkey-json` project is just for fun. I want to write JSON parser from the scratch.  
The implementation of `monkey-json` conforms to [RFC8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-2) as possible as I can.  
I disregarded some rules on [RFC8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-2). Because It's super boring to keep some of them(especially `Number`).  

You can use `monkey-json` as a command line tool.
